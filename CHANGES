Revision history for Perl module Math::Float32

0.02
  -  More tests added.
  -  Add pack_flt_hex() function.
  -  Enable handling of base 2 strings that match /^(\s+)?[\-\+]?0b/i
     The strtof() function does not handle such strings, so we convert
     them to a hex equivalent before passing them on.

0.01
  -  First release.
