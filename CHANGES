Revision history for Perl module Math::Float32

0.03
  - Correction to "repository" location in Makefile.PL.
  - In t/mpfr_checks.t we make allowance for *BSD sloppiness re the
    calculations of log(), exp() and '**' operations, whhich can be
    1ULP closer to zero than they ought to be.

0.02
  -  More tests added.
  -  Add pack_flt_hex() function.
  -  Enable handling of base 2 strings that match /^(\s+)?[\-\+]?0b/i
     The strtof() function does not handle such strings, so we convert
     them to a hex equivalent before passing them on.

0.01
  -  First release.
